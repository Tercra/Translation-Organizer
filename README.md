# Translation Organizer

Creating an application using WPF to organize what you are translating.

How to separate the document/work you are translating:
  - Paragraphs
  - Paragraphs are separated into sentences (which are separated by 3 layers of translation)
    - Japanese (The words in their original form)
    - Romaji (Basically the pronounciation of the words)
    - English (The translation)
